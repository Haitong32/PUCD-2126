    <h1>If You Forget Me</h1>

    <div id="container">
      <p id="first">I want you to know
one thing.</p>
      <p id="second">
      You know how this is:
      <br/>if I look
      at the crystal moon, at the red branch
      of the slow autumn at my window,
      <br/>if I touch
      near the fire
      the impalpable ash
      or the wrinkled body of the log,
      <br/>everything carries me to you,
      as if everything that exists,
      aromas, light, metals,
      <br/>were little boats
      that sail
      <br/>toward those isles of yours that wait for me.
      </p>
      <p id="third">
      Well, now,
      <br/>if little by little you stop loving me
      <br/>I shall stop loving you little by little.
      </p>
      <p id="forth">
      If suddenly
      you forget me
      <br/>do not look for me,
      <br/>for I shall already have forgotten you.
      </p>
      <p id="fifth">
      If you think it long and mad,
      <br/>the wind of banners
      that passes through my life,
      <br/>and you decide
      to leave me at the shore
      of the heart where I have roots,
      <br/>remember
      <br/>that on that day,
      <br/>at that hour,
      <br/>I shall lift my arms
      and my roots will set off
      <br/>to seek another land.</p>
      <p id="sixth">
      But
      <br/>if each day,
      <br/>each hour,
      <br/>you feel that you are destined for me
      with implacable sweetness,
      <br/>if each day a flower
      climbs up to your lips to seek me,
      <br/>ah my love, ah my own,
      <br/>in me all that fire is repeated,
      <br/>in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
      <br/>my love feeds on your love, beloved,
      <br/>and as long as you live it will be in your arms
      <br/>without leaving mine</p>
